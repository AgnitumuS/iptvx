# iptvx

IPTV player and streamer for Linux that allows to play any stream that LibVLC can play, offers an overlay based on WebKit using HTML5, JavaScript and CSS and uses XMLTV data for EPG information. It allows the playback of URLs, files and can grab URLs from shell scripts. XMLTV EPG data can be downloaded directly from URLs or grabbed from shell scripts.

## Current status

Currently iptvx is still under development and in alpha-phase. Which means that the source code is only available and building might not work on your target system. The only intended users at the moment are software engineers that are capable of understanding the C code.
